/*
### Create an in-memory cache that can hold a maximum of 255 keys and satisfies the interface given below.
System Considerations:
Â - If the cache is at capacity and a `Get` method is called, apply an `Oldest` eviction policy.
### Implement a HTTP or gRPC server that can handle the following requests:
- Get a key from the cache
- Set a key in the cache
- Get the cache statistics

System Considerations:
- The cache should be shared across all requests.
- No need to worry about authentication or authorization.

### Bonus Points:
- Unit tests
- Containerization
- Documentation
- Error handling
